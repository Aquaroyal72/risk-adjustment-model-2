0b. (*Costs and Premiums PMM by state.*) I calculated the weighted (by member month) average of costs and premiums and (premium - cost) (all per member month) for each state in the individual market for 2014 and 2015 - see costspremiumspmm.xlsx.

0c. (*Degree of market concentrations by state.*) We can measure this with the Herfindahl Index, which is the square of the percentages of market share. The Herfindahl Index goes from 0 (perfect competition) to 10000 (monopoly).  As expected, Alaska has a very close to monopolistic situation (9000), and Rhode Island is also high (8000), but surprisingly, states like Wyoming have values around 5000, which indicates some competition going on. New York in 2014 in the individual market had probably what we would say is closest to perfect competition, with an index of 945. Massachusetts, Ohio, and California are also pretty low (2000s range). See herfindahlindex.xlsx.
