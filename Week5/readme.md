# Week 5

1. (*Rigorous, systematic statistics per state (IWMath.pdf).*) I will create datasets containing member months for individual group and small group for 2014 and 2015. I want to make the calculator faster.

The calculator is used in two ways: weighting states by their state total member months / national total member months, and weighting companies within states by their member months / state total member months. I need to draw a distinction between the two.

2. (*Linear Regression.*) We want to fit data to the following model: 

Transfers ~ a* Premium + b*Costs 

- - -

3. (*For-profit status.*) We want to see if for-profit status affects correlations.

- - -

4. (*Actuarial Value correlations.*) Similar to PLRS correlations from last time, see if Actuarial Value is correlated with transfers.

- - -

5. (*Distribution of correlations of Premiums/Costs/Transfers per state*). We want to see how correlations of the following are distributed per state:

premiums vs. costs

premiums vs. transfers

costs vs. transfers
