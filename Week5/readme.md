# Week 5

1. (*Rigorous, systematic statistics per state (IWMath.pdf).*) I will create datasets containing member months for individual group and small group for 2014 and 2015. I want to make the calculator faster.

The calculator is used in two ways: weighting states by their state total member months / national total member months, and weighting companies within states by their member months / state total member months. I need to draw a distinction between the two.
