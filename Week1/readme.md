# Week 1

1. Look into Appendix A tables. Between March and June, average risk score (PLRS) goes up. How do plans respond to this if scores change dramatically?
2. How are conditions that flare up billed? Such as, do you charge for last year's heart attack?
3. Look at correlations and statistics: absolute value of transfers over premiums by state, sparsity vs. loss, sparsity vs. average transfer, below 80% MLR two yeras in a row?
