# Week 1

1. (*Warmup.*) Look into Appendix A tables. Between March and June, average risk score (PLRS) goes up. How do plans respond to this if scores change dramatically?

All states' PLRS goes up, on average by approximately 8 cents. That is about 1/20 of a condition. That could also account for new babies born/new complications that arise in billing between March and June. Thus, this PLRS increase is reasonable and perhaps does not reflect upcoding to gain more money between those two months.

I have looked at the changes from the 2016 benefit year, as interim data from the 2015 benefit year is not available on the CMS website. These datasets come from the "Appendix A" datasets on their Medical Loss Ratio data webpage. Hawaii for whatever reason did not have interim March data, so I took it out. So, we are missing Vermont and Hawaii. In the individual group, across 48 states, on average, the difference in PLRS was $0.09. In the small group market, across 48 states, the average difference in PLRS was $0.07.

2. (*Upcoding and Downcoding.*) How are conditions that flare up billed? Such as, do you charge for last year's heart attack?

I could not find this, but Prof. Braverman found an article saying that there was a certain time period within which different conditions could be billed. (TBD: Look for the article?)

I read the paper on PLRS (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4214270/) twice and I have not found any indication of how it is billed, whether upcoding or downcoding patient issues exist. What I understand is that the government gives the values, based on reported diagnoses. This lends itself to upcoding, or reporting more illnesses to try to game more money from the risk transfer system (6 to 16% higher risk scores in private versus public Medicare plans, as shown in this paper http://www.nber.org/papers/w21222). So, I believe is in an insurer's best interest to bill for a heart attack every year after the patient has a heart attack. Just like many of the other assumptions that the risk transfer formula was based on, these seem unfounded. To support this, an outside consultant Milliman says the following: "When working with a particular coding vendor (or in house) to develop a coding improvement effort, it is important to be realistic regarding the gain that should be expected in a carrier's risk score. There are many ways to estimate the potential for coding improvement" which pretty explicitly says that an insurer can gain by manipulating a risk score (http://www.milliman.com/uploadedFiles/insight/2016/2157HDP_20160127_value-of-aca-coding.pdf).  I wonder which insurers are aware of this and which ones are not. At the same time, if all insurers are greedy (a rational assumption), is it a good thing to have them all compete to mark everyone as more sick?

3. (*Tax Code.*) Did the tax code that passed last December repeal the individual mandate? Does this mean that premiums will go up for everyone as there is no incentive for healthy people to pay for insurance for something they do not use vs. pay nothing in a fine if they do not enroll? Would member months decrease, thus making insurance less profitable PMM?

Yes, the tax code that passed in December 2017 repealed the individual mandate. Premiums may not go up for everyone significantly, since the people who are on the fence about buying insurance are not are usually working-age, relatively middle class, who do not receive healthcare insurance through their employer, but can afford healthcare insurance otherwise, and do not have dependents. There are very few jobs that can pay this amount while not giving out healthcare insurance, one of them being freelancing. There are probably very few freelancers--or people in similar job positions--in this situation out there, as they would most probably have dependents. So, this repealing of the individual mandate is probably a symbolic action than one that has policy implications.

4. (*Vermont.*) How does Vermont use a merged group mode between the individual and small group markets? It may be the closest thing to single payer healthcare that we get in the U.S. I wonder what the incentive is for allowing groups of up to 100 to be classified in this merged market (rather than large market) as well. Would that just be for expanding their merged group pool to lower prices for everyone?

In short, Vermont is a small state, which makes this very feasible.
