(1) Does losing money cause plans to drop out the next year? Do negative transfers make them drop out?

Among companies reporting premiums, costs, and transfers... the market is relatively stable. 

I took the same data from before, where the "leading year" had MM > 2000. 

I have the same problem as not knowing how to define "exiting the market". I defined "exiting the market" as not reporting risk transfers in the following year, not reporting MM the following year, or having MM < 2000 the following year.

2014 -> 2015

(Avg Premium, Avg Costs, Avg Transfers, Avg Premium - Costs)

379 companies reported all 3 things and stayed in the market
314.7151	368.8403	15.85123	-53.3714

6 companies reported all 3 things and exited the market
317.9302	379.6681	47.73126	-61.7378

Can't infer much from a 6 company sample size, but it looks like most of the companies we saw exit last time were small ones that got filtered out. 

2015 -> 2016

362 companies reported all 3 things and stayed in the market
347.8353	389.4214	7.409636	-41.5861

70 companies reported all 3 things and exited the market (lost less than avg, weird)
336.5158	408.7012	1.095228	-72.1854

Lower premiums, higher costs, more loss. Not sure about the transfers, especially due to the small sample size.


(2) Same q, but instead of dropping out consider changes in MMs (need to be careful since we drop off outliers in terms of MMs). 
(3) Same q, but instead of dropping out consider changes in premiums per MM.
