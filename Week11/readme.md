With removing outliers (specifically, Assurant Inc., which includes Time Insurance Company and John Alden Life Insurance Company; and Aetna and Humana as the buyout of Humana failed, so I'm not sure what eventually happened...)

First, I looked at exit rates: what fraction of each quintile exits the market, based on quintiles of TotalPC = Premiums - Costs + Transfers + Reinsurance (all per member month). I am personally confused why so many companies in the top quintile in 2014 did exit the market. It looks like some companies (specifically Time Insurance Company and John Alden Life Insurance Company) have something larger going on. Indeed, John Alden and Time are subsidiaries of Assurant, and are outliers. From Wikipedia, "On June 10, 2015 Assurant announced an exit from the health insurance marketplace to focus on housing and lifestyle specialty protection products and services, and would be winding down its Assurant Health business." Further, from Wikipedia, "The health insurer Aetna said on July 3, 2015, that it had agreed to acquire its smaller rival Humana for $37 billion in cash and stock[8] but walked away from the deal after a court ruling that the merger would be anti-competitive.[9]" I think something happened with Aetna and Humana, but I'm not sure what, so I removed them from the analysis as well.
